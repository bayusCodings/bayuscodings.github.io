          <p>
            At Blusalt, I‚Äôve been at the forefront of developing digital infrastructure for seamless payments and financial services. 
            I played a key role in optimizing systems that process thousands of bill payments daily, ensuring smooth and reliable transactions for our customers. 
          </p>
          <p>
            A major highlight of my work has been transforming Blusalt‚Äôs core service from a monolithic architecture to a microservices-based structure, significantly boosting performance and scalability. 
            I also collaborate closely with the support team to swiftly address client-reported issues, enhancing the platform‚Äôs responsiveness and reliability.

          <p>
            During my time at VerifyMe, I contributed to building the digital trust infrastructure for Nigeria, 
            bringing secure and efficient identity verification solutions to the market. 
            My contributions included building a sophisticated facial recognition system that went beyond simple image matching; 
            it ensured biometric traits matched living individuals, effectively blocking fraud attempts using static images.
          </p>
				  <p>
            I also optimized several core services that processed thousands of identity verifications daily,
            crucial for businesses relying on trusted verifications. Additionally, I introduced a performance-based 
            rating system for agents, enabling more accurate evaluations and helping to motivate a high standard of service.

          <p>
            At Swipe, I was immersed in an environment focused on digital solutions across Africa. 
            I played a pivotal role in building a fraud detection system that brought a 10% reduction in fraudulent activities for a financial services provider. 
            This system used machine learning insights to assess risk levels for transactions, providing real-time fraud alerts.

          <p>
            At Cregital, I had the opportunity to work on innovative projects that spanned multiple regions, from Africa to North America. 
            One of the highlights was creating a joint investment platform for Volition Capital, a service used by thousands of users worldwide. This platform facilitated seamless investments, 
            providing real-time updates and reliable transaction processing, which earned praise from clients for its reliability and user-friendly design.
